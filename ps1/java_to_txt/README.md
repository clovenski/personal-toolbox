# Introduction

These two scripts were used in my Numerical Methods class.

Homework was coded in java and the source code was to be printed out along with the program's output appended to it.

Instead of copying and pasting, these two scripts automate the process of creating a text file for each java file in a specified directory and appending the output at the end of the text file, as well as printing all the text files in the specified directory.

## Usage

+ Reside these two scripts in a folder wherein there are subfolders that contain java source code to be printed.
+ Ensure that the java files are compiled and the class files exist for each.
+ Run the first script, MakePrintReady, passing as an argument the subfolder name that ccontain the java files to make print-ready.
+ Run the second script, PrintFiles, passing the subfolder name again.

## Notes

Enter the printer name in PrintFiles if needing to print to a different printer rather than the default.
